# http-https-echo-chart ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/germanattanasio/http-https-echo-chart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/germanattanasio/http-https-echo-chart)

This helm chart deploys the [`http-https-echo`](https://github.com/mendhak/docker-http-https-echo) docker image to a kubernetes environment.

Kudos to [`mendhak`](https://github.com/mendhak) ðŸ™ŒðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `http-https-echo` located in the current directory:

```bash
helm install http-https-echo . --wait
```

This command deploys the chart with sane defaults.

A k8s service will be created with a ClusterIP configuration exposing two ports:
 
* 8080 -> HTTP
* 8443 -> HTTPs

To install a K8s Ingress with a custom certificate located in [certificates/tls-cert.crt](certificates/tls-cert.crt),
a CA certificate located in [certificates/ca-cert.crt](certificates/ca-cert.crt) and with a private key located in
[certificates/tls-key.pem](certificates/tls-key.pem):

```bash
helm install http-https-echo . \
  --wait \
  --set ingress.tls.enabled=true \
  --set ingress.tls.caCertificate="$(cat certificates/ca-cert.crt)" \
  --set ingress.tls.certificate="$(cat certificates/tls-cert.crt)" \
  --set ingress.tls.key="$(cat certificates/tls-key.pem)"
```

## Verifying the Chart

See NOTES.txt associated with this chart for verification instructions

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `http-https-echo` deployment:

```bash
helm uninstall http-https-echo
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
